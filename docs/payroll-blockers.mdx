If there is a payroll blocker throughout the process, you will receive a `payroll_blocker` category 422 error. You will be able to get the reason for the error using the `metadata`.

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "error_key": "base",
      "category": "payroll_blocker",
      "message": "Company or employee address could not be verified. Please ensure all addresses are valid.",
      "metadata": {
        "key": "geocode_error"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
