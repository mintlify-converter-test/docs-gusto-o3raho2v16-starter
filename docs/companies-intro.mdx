Gusto Embedded's company APIs enable the collection of all company and employee related data needed to run payroll. Use the company APIs to onboard new companies, migrate existing companies, create company benefits, and collect company related forms. To save on development time and accelerate time to market, you can also utilize our prebuilt company onboarding Flow end-to-end or modularize the Flow by utilizing only the specific steps that you need.
