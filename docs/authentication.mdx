Gusto Embedded supports two types of tokens that are used throughout development: company-level tokens and system-level tokens.

System access tokens allow you to carry out application level actions such as:

*   Creating a partner managed company
*   Viewing invoices

Company access tokens allow you to carry out company level actions, such as:

*   Getting company employees
*   Running payroll for a company

Each partner managed company has a single access token that cannot be used to access other companies. If you're on a version older than `2023-05-01`, see [Upgrading to Strict Access](/embedded-payroll/docs/strict-access)
 for more information on upgrading to strict access.

See the [System Access Tokens](/embedded-payroll/docs/system-access-access)
 and [Company Access Tokens](/embedded-payroll/docs/company-access-tokens)
 for more details.
