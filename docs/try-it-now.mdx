The purpose of the Demo Flow below is to showcase the Flows in action without API keys. This demo defaults to the entire Company Onboarding Flow, but you can check out other available Flows by changing the type from "Select a type".

> ## 📘
> 
> When using the Try It Now functionality for this flow it can take 15+ minutes to generate all the necessary objects and data for an onboarded company with a variety of employees. Until this is complete the flow will display “All payrolls are processed.” for any Payroll flow.

To test these Flows yourself, you should create a [Partner Managed Company](/embedded-payroll/reference/post-v1-partner-managed-companies)
 and make the API call to generate Flows.
