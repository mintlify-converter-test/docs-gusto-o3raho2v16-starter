Gusto Embedded Flows are pre-built UI components you can use to quickly and easily incorporate essential payroll functionality into your build.

Flows are commonly used to gather pertinent payroll information that isnâ€™t currently collected from customers, saving your engineering teams from developing methods to do so from scratch and greatly accelerating your time to market. Flows can be used on their own and/or in conjunction with our APIs.

You can demo all available Flows [here](/embedded-payroll/docs/try-it-now)
.
