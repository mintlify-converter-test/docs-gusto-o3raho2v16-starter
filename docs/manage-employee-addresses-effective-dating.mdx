title: "Employee Address Changes"
description: "Proper effective dating for compliance."
---
Employees may move to a new home or work address during their tenure with a company. These changes may impact their and/or a company’s tax liability so effective dating should be leveraged to ensure these moves are properly recorded for compliance purposes. Proper utilization of effective dating will reduce downstream tax notices and the need for expedited/reversal payrolls as a result of last minute address changes.

### Get an Employee’s Home Addresses

The home address of an employee will determine certain tax information about them. Addresses are geocoded when created and updated to ensure validity. Use the [Get an employee’s home addresses](/embedded-payroll/reference/get-v1-employees-employee_id-home_addresses)
 endpoint to retrieve all employee home addresses in effective date order and to determine if there is an applicable courtesy withholding. The address with the status `"active": true,` is the employee’s current active home address. The `effective_date` signifies when the employee began living at this location. `”courtesy_withholding”: true` indicates there is an active courtesy withholding at this location.

> ## 📘Courtesy Withholdings
> 
> Federal law prohibits two states from taxing the same income—for employees who live and work in different states, and file more than one state tax return, reciprocal agreements exist so that they only pay income taxes to one state (usually their home state of residency) on the same wages.
> 
> Several states have reciprocal agreements with other states, ensuring that employees who work and live in those different states, don’t have to have taxes withheld in more than one of them. A courtesy withholding allows an employer to elect that Gusto will withhold and pay an employee's home state taxes instead.

### Create an Employee’s Home Address

Use the [Create an employee’s home address](/embedded-payroll/reference/post-v1-employees-employee_id-home_addresses)
 endpoint to create a new home address for an employee. The path param for creating a new employee home address is `employee_id` and you are able to set the `effective_date` before, during, or after the current effective date range. It cannot be the same as an existing home address `effective_date`.

```curl
curl --request POST  
     --url <https://api.gusto-demo.com/v1/employees/{employee_id}/{home_addresses}>  
     --header 'accept: application/json'  
     --header 'authorization: Bearer access_token'

This endpoint allows you to update any attribute except `uuid`, `version`, `employee_uuid`, `active`, and `country`. You cannot update the effective date of the earliest home address.

Use the [Delete an employee’s home address](/embedded-payroll/reference/delete-v1-home_addresses-home_address_uuid)

     --url <https://api.gusto-demo.com/v1/home_addresses/{home_address_uuid}>
