> Providing access to Contractor Payment Receipts is a **required step**. All partners must implement Contractor Payment Receipts.

All Contractor Payments which result in ACH movement of money require that a receipt be available once the payment has been funded. Contractor Payments are funded when the ACH transfer for the payment has been initiated. This receipt must contain:

*   A receipt ID
*   The name of the sender
*   The name of the recipient
*   The ACH debit date
*   The total ACH debit amount
*   The amounts debited for contractor wage pay, bonus, and reimbursements
*   Licensee information (The licensee is Gusto)
*   Link to license details, right to refund and liability information (Links to Gusto)

## Receipt Availability

Receipts are available for all Contractor Payments which are paid by direct deposit and have been funded. Receipt requests for Contractor Payment Receipts will return a 404 Not Found Response if the payment method is by check or the payment has been canceled or reversed.

## Step By Step Instructions

All of the information needed to display a Contractor Payment Receipt can be obtained from a single Contractor Payment Receipt request. To fetch the data, make a GET request to the Get a [Contractor Payment Receipt](https://docs.gusto.com/embedded-payroll/reference/get-v1-contractor_payments-contractor_payment_uuid-receipt)
 endpoint with the required `contractor_payment_uuid` parameter. This endpoint accepts no optional parameters.

> ## üößUUIID Only
> 
> The Contractor Payment Receipt endpoint is identified by the Contractor Payment UUID only. Passing the Contractor Payment ID instead of UUID will result in a 404 Not Found response.
