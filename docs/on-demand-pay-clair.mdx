## What is On-Demand Pay / Earned Wage Access (EWA)?

On-Demand Pay, also known as Earned Wage Access (EWA), gives employees the option to access earned wages / funds before their scheduled payday. Clair on-demand pay is available through the Company and Employee Earned Wage Access Enrollment Flows.

### 2\. Clair - Account Signup

Upon opt-in, employees will be able to sign up for a Clair account by providing information like name, email, and SSN. On occasion, employees will need to wait to have their information verified.

> Gusto employee onboarding can be completed without Clair. In addition, the employee must be fully onboarded through Gusto before they will be able to use Clair‚Äôs ODP service. Partners offering Clair may need to provide additional guidance here.
