When subscribed to the `Form` webhooks you will receive the following events:

| event\_type | description | references |
| --- | --- | --- |
| company.form.created | Company form has been created | {"company\_uuid": ""} |
| company.form.updated | Company form has been updated | {"company\_uuid": ""} |
| company.form.signed | Company form has been signed | {"company\_uuid": ""} |
| contractor.form.created | Contractor form has been created | {"contractor\_uuid": ""} |
| contractor.form.updated | Contractor form has been update | {"contractor\_uuid": ""} |
| contractor.form.signed | Contractor form has been signed | {"contractor\_uuid": ""} |
| employee.form.created | Employee form has been created | {"employee\_uuid": ""} |
| employee.form.updated | Employee form has been update | {"employee\_uuid": ""} |
| employee.form.signed | Employee form has been signed | {"employee\_uuid": ""} |

Form webhooks contain `references` that will have the additional UUIDs to call the Gusto API to retrieve the entire **entity**. The example below contains **references** because an employee UUID is required to retrieve the form from the API /v1/employees/{employee\_uuid}/forms/{form\_uuid}
