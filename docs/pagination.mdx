## Overview

To enhance API performance, several collection endpoints support pagination. To use this feature add a `page` and, optionally, a `per` parameter to the URL's query string. For example, the following url...

```
https://api.gusto.com/v1/companies/abc123/employees?page=2&per=5

```

...will return the second page of five employees of the company identified by the UUID `abc123`. If the `per` parameter is not provided, the API will return 25 records per page by default, unless otherwise specified.

Information on whether a given endpoint supports pagination parameters can be found on its respective page in the documentation.

## Paginated responses

If pagination parameters are provided in the request, some metadata about the paginated collection will be returned in the response's headers.

```
X-Page: 3
X-Total-Count: 542
X-Total-Pages: 22
X-Per-Page: 25

```

Here's a summary of the meaning of each of these headers:

| Header | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `X-Page` | The current page being returned | `3` |
| `X-Total-Count` | The total number of records in the full collection | `542` |
| `X-Total-Pages` | Total number of pages for this collection | `22` |
| `X-Per-Page` | Numer of records currently being returned per page | `25` |

  

## Cursor based pagination

Some of our APIs support cursor based pagination in order to ensure more consistent results on some of our more real-time data models. Rather than a `page` and `per` parameter, cursor based pagination will use a `start_after_uuid` and `limit` parameter. The following API will return the next 5 records after the given UUID:

```
https://api.gusto.com/v1/events?starting_after_uuid=10ac74e7-d6f0-46c0-9697-8ec77ab475ba&limit=5

```

Cursor paginated APIs will return the following header

```
X-Has-Next-Page: true | false

```

A value of `true` indicates that there is another page of results. When true, clients may use the UUID of the last record in the response as the `starting_after_uuid` value to fetch the next page of results.
