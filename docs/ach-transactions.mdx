## What is an ACH Transaction?

As a payroll processor, Gusto uses the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network to debit from a company‚Äôs bank account, deposit into an employee or contractor‚Äôs bank account, and remit payroll taxes to external tax agencies (both state and federal). Whenever an ACH transaction occurs, Gusto will create an internal record which captures the transaction details (ex: payment event type, error code, credit / debit, payment date, etc.).

## Pulling ACH Transactions for a Company

This `GET companies/{company_uuid}/ach_transactions`[endpoint](/embedded-payroll/reference/get-ach-transactions)
is useful to gain visibility into the flow of funds within ACH transactions on a per company basis, both successful and unsuccessful (the latter of which result in bank errors). Partners may use this endpoint to track granular bank ACH transaction data as it pertains to the movement of money, to whom the money was transferred, and when those funds were moved.

The following call will fetch all ACH transactions for a specific company:

```curl
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.gusto-demo.com/v1/companies/company_uuid/ach_transactions \
     --header 'accept: application/json'

``````curl
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const url = 'https://api.gusto-demo.com/v1/companies/{company_uuid}/external_payrolls/tax_liabilities/finish';
const options = {method: 'PUT', headers: {authorization: 'Bearer COMPANY_API_TOKEN'}};

fetch(url, options)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json))
  .catch(err => console.error('error:' + err));

```

### Query Parameters

Optional parameters can be added to requests in order to help filter for specific company ACH transactions (ex: ‚Äútransaction\_type‚Äù: ‚ÄúDebit net pay,‚Äù).

| Query Parameters | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| contractor\_payment\_uuid | The UUID of the contractor payment. |
| payroll\_uuid | The UUID of the payroll. |
| transaction\_type | Used to filter the ACH transactions to only include those with a specific transaction type, such as "Credit employee pay". [Click here](/embedded-payroll/docs/ach-codes-and-transaction-types) for a full list of transaction types. |
