When subscribed to the `BankAccount` webhooks you will receive the following events:

| event\_type | description | references |
| --- | --- | --- |
| company.bank\_account.created | Company bank account has been created | {"company\_uuid": ""} |
| company.bank\_account.verified | Company bank account has been verified | {"company\_uuid": ""} |
| company.bank\_account.updated | Company bank account has been updated | {"company\_uuid": ""} |
| company.bank\_account.deleted | Company bank account has been deleted | {"company\_uuid": ""} |
| contractor.bank\_account.created | Contractor bank account has been created | {"contractor\_uuid": ""} |
| contractor.bank\_account.updated | Contractor bank account has been updated | {"contractor\_uuid": ""} |
| contractor.bank\_account.deleted | Contractor bank account has been deleted | {"contractor\_uuid": ""} |
| employee.bank\_account.created | Employee bank account has been created | {"employee\_uuid": ""} |
| employee.bank\_account.updated | Employee bank account has been updated | {"employee\_uuid": ""} |
| employee.bank\_account.deleted | Employee bank account has been deleted | {"employee\_uuid": ""} |

Bank account webhooks contain `references` that will have the additional UUIDs to call the Gusto API to retrieve the entire **entity**. The example below contains **references** because an employee UUID is required to retrieve the bank account from the API /v1/employees/{employee\_id}/payment\_method
