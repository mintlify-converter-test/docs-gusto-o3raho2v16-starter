title: "Sunsetting Direct Emails"
description: "Transition to partner notifications infrastructure, phasing out direct emails in Q1 2024."
---
Currently, our system sends emails from Gusto.com to your customers to inform them of critical communications for compliance reasons. We plan to sunset direct email communications and transition partners to leverage our new [partner notifications infrastructure](partner-notifications)
.

> ## ðŸš§In Q1 2024, we will be deprecating all critical Gusto.com emails after launching all remaining Notification categories.
> 
> The table below indicates which emails have been replaced with our new notification system. This is not a comprehensive list of all Gusto.com emails that are currently being sent to end users.
> 
> This migration is on-going; we will continue to update this page as new categories are rolled out.
