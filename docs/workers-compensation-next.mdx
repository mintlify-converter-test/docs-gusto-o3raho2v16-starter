## What is Workers' Compensation?

Workers‚Äô compensation can help cover expenses for employee medical care, lost wages and other expenses due to a workplace injury. It can help employees if they are injured on the job and protects employers from significant financial losses after a workplace injury occurs.

Workers‚Äô Compensation is commonly offered by payroll providers who support employers within construction, cleaning, and retail industries. Likewise, most states require employees to have a form of workers‚Äô compensation.

## Offering Workers' Compensation

Workers‚Äô compensation through NEXT is available through the Workers‚Äô Compensation Flow (company\_workers\_compensation).
