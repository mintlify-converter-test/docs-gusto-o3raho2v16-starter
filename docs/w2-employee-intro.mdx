Employees are a critical part of payroll. Companies themselves are, naturally, a collection of one to hundreds of employees that must be paid on a regular cadence for work done.

Gusto Embedded's employee APIs allow users to onboard, manage, and pay individuals who have payments withheld for federal and state income tax, Social Security, and Medicare. Use the employee APIs to onboard new employees including employee self-onboarding, create jobs & compensation, create benefits & deductions, collect employee related forms, and terminate employees. To save on development time and accelerate time to market, you can also utilize our prebuilt employee onboarding Flow end-to-end or modularize the Flow by utilizing only the specific steps that you need.
