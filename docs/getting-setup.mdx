### Setting your API version

You can set the API version by including a `X-Gusto-API-Version` header in your API calls.

```curl
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.gusto-demo.com/v1/me \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
     --header 'X-Gusto-API-Version: 2022-09-15'

```

If no `X-Gusto-API-Version` is specified, the minimum API version will be used. You may notice that all Gusto API request URLs include `v1`. This should remain the same for all requests regardless of API version; the value passed into the `X-Gusto-API-Version` header will determine the date-based API version associated with your API call.

We also pass back the `X-Gusto-API-Version` in the response header as a way for callers to confirm that their requested `X-Gusto-API-Version` was respected.

### Minimum API Version

We use your application’s minimum API version to validate the supplied `X-Gusto-API-Version` header version. If the header version is using an API version that is _**older**_ than the minimum API version, your API request will return a `406 Not Acceptable` error.

```json
{
  "name": "Invalid X-Gusto-API-Version Header",
  "message": "Invalid API Version `2022-09-15`. Version must be >= your application's minimum API version `2022-11-01` and not in the future."
}
```

> ### Version Creation
> 
> When you create a demo application, the minimum API version is automatically set to the latest stable version of our API. Your production application’s minimum API version will be set during the launch process.

You can view your applications minimum API version in the [Developer Portal](https://dev.gusto.com/account/sign_in)
