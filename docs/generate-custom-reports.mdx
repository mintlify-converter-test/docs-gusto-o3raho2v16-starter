Gusto provides the capability to create custom reports using custom columns, groupings, and optional filters.

## 1\. Create custom report

To create a custom report through the Gusto API, use the POST companies/{company\_uuid}/reports [endpoint](/embedded-payroll/reference/post-companies-company_uuid-reports)
.

The endpoint accepts the following body params:

*   `columns` - This is a list of columns to include in your report, in the order they are requested in the array.
*   `groupings` - How to group the report. Use this field to create reports structured by payroll, employee, or work address with any combination or order. Some of the columns and filters require certain groupings in order to create the report. For example, employee information such as `employee_email` and employee filters such as `employment_status` require the `employee` grouping.
*   `file_type` - This is the file type of the report URL that gets generated. We currently only support `csv` and `json`.  
    `custom_name` - Title of the report
*   `with_totals` - Whether to include subtotals and grand totals in the report, this is defaulted to `false`
*   `start_date`/`end_date` - This is the time period to filter the report by.
    *   If no values are provided, the time period is defaulted to all-time.
        *   If only the start date is specified, the time period will be after the start date.
        *   If only the end date is specified, the time period will be before the end date.
    *   If there is payroll information, this filter uses the payroll end date to filter the time period.
    *   If there is employee information, we filter to employees that were active during this time period.
    *   If there is work address information, we show work addresses that were associated with employees during this time period.
*   `dismissed_start_date`/`dismissed_end_date` - Dismissed employees’ time period to filter the report by
    *   If only the dismissed start date is specified, the dismissed time period will be after the start date.
    *   If only the dismissed end date is specified, the dismissed time period will be before the end date.
*   `employment_status` - Filter by the employee employment status, ex: `active`, `dismissed`, etc.'
*   `employment_type` - Filter by the employee employment type, ex: `exempt`, `non_exempt`, etc.
*   `payment_method` - Filter by payment method, `check` or `direct_deposit`
*   `department_uuids` - Filter by the departments employees are assigned to
*   `employee_uuids` - Filter by the company employees
*   `work_address_uuids` - Filter by the work addresses employees are assigned to

The response will contain the following information:

*   `request_uuid` - A unique identifier of the report request (to be used in the Step 2 to fetch the report)
*   `company_uuid` - company UUID
*   `custom_name` - Title of the report
*   `file_type` - file type requested, `csv` or `json`

## 2\. Get report

To get the report, use the GET /reports/{request\_uuid} [endpoint](/embedded-payroll/reference/get-reports-report_uuid)
 using the `request_uuid` returned from Step 1.

The response will contain the following information:

*   `request_uuid` - A unique identifier of the report request
*   `report_urls` - an array that is either empty when status: pending or failed, or contains the URL of the report when `"status": "succeeded"`
*   `status` - `pending`, `succeeded`, or `failed`

Once Step 1 is successful, repeatedly poll this endpoint every few seconds to verify whether the report has finished generating. The terminal state will always be either `succeeded` or `failed`.

## 3\. Get report template (optional)

Before Step 1, use the GET companies/{company\_uuid}/report\_templates/{report\_type} [endpoint](/embedded-payroll/reference/get-companies-company_uuid-report-templates-report_type)
 to get a recommended list of columns and groupings to use to create a report. We currently only support payroll\_journal as a report type, but will continue to support more in the future.

The response will contain the following information:

*   `columns` - A list of recommended columns to use
*   `groupings` - A list of recommended groupings to use
*   `company_uuid` - company UUID
*   `report_type` - type of report template

## Flows Guide

To get started, generate a reports flow via API call to our Flows endpoint.

```curl
cURL  
curl --request POST  
     --url <https://api.gusto-demo.com/v1/companies/{{company_uuid}}/flows>  
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}’'  
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json'  
     --data ' { "flow_type": "reports" }'

```

From the landing page, either create a report using our payroll journal template as a starting point or completely from scratch. From there, we grouped the columns based on Payroll, Employee, Work address, and Employer for easier access. This way, we have pre-grouped the columns to their required groupings. Then, add any optional filters to the report for more customization. Finally, click on **Generate report** to download the report.
